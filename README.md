# Pixels4Nibbles
is an r/place clone that incentivizes people to donate food to food drives. 

## Hardware Requirements
This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a display, and a mouse placed in a public location. 

## How it works
When a person donates food, they place the food item in a chute with an ultrasonic sensor that sees the food item pass by. The program responds to this donation by rewarding the user with a number of pixels which they are allowed to place on a shared pixel art board. 

## Credits

This project was created for the Skyline High School Technology Student Association's 2022 community service project.
